# RMFlickr

## Synopsis

RMFlickr is a simple iPhone app written in Swift that displays a list of photo thumbnails fetched from the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html). The app displays the the latest public photos uploaded to Flickr in a scrollable table view. When the user selects a photo from the table, a second screen with a larger photo is opened up.
